# mmt-hectospec-automated-detection
Automated detection routines written in IDL for MMT/Hectospec (Hong et al. 2014, PASP, 126, 1048)


1. Description : 

This program depends on "hsred" and some hidden IDL routines, as many IDL routines have similar issues. This is the reason why python is getting more common in astronomy. Hence, this repository might be for back-up purpose, rather sharing purpose, though some people still can try this.
